**Important Note:** We will again make use of Minio object store in this Lab. We will use it as the endpoint for our cloud snapshots. 


Please wait while we deploy and configure Minio on this Kubernetes cluster. This can take up to 5 minutes.

Once the set-up is complete, you can run the following command to make sure the minio servers are up:

`mc admin info px`{{execute}}
