First we need to wait for Kubernetes and Portworx to be ready. Be patient, this is not a very high performance environment, just a place to learn something :-

### Step: Wait for Kubernetes to be ready

Click the below section which waits for all Kubernetes nodes to be ready.
```
watch kubectl get nodes
```{{execute T1}}

When all 4 nodes show status Running then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

### Step: Wait for Portworx to be ready

Watch the Portworx pods and wait for them to be ready on all the nodes. This can take a few minutes since it involves pulling multiple docker images. You will see 'No resources found' until all images are pulled.

```
watch kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l name=portworx -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

When all the pods show STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.

You can take a look at the cluster status using the pxctl command line tool:
```
PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $PX_POD -n kube-system -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl status
```{{execute T1}}

Now that we have the Portworx cluster up, let's proceed to the next step !


Before we deploy cassandra, we will need to create a Portworx volume (PVC) for Cassandra. In order to create PVCs, we need a StorageClass which defined the class of storage available to us.

### Step: Create StorageClass

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f cassandra-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}



Now use kubectl to deploy Cassandra.
```
kubectl create -f cassandra.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify Cassandra pod is ready

Below commands wait till the Cassandra pod are in ready state. Take note of the node it's running on.
```
watch kubectl get pods  -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

This takes a few minutes, when the cassandra-0 and cqlsh pods are in STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.


In this step, we will initialize a sample database in our cassandra instance.

### Step: Create a table and insert data

Start a CQL Shell session:
```
kubectl exec -it cqlsh -- cqlsh cassandra-0.cassandra.default.svc.cluster.local --cqlversion=3.4.4
```{{execute T1}}


```
CREATE KEYSPACE portworx WITH REPLICATION = {'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':3};
USE portworx;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS songs (song_title text, artist_name text,year int, album_name text,single text, PRIMARY KEY (year, artist_name));
```{{execute T1}}


```
INSERT INTO portworx.features((song_title,artist_name,  year,album_name, text,single) VALUES("Across The Universe", "The Beatles", "1970", "Let It Be", "False");
INSERT INTO portworx.features((song_title,artist_name,  year,album_name, text,single) VALUES("Think For Yourself", "The Beatles", "1965", "Let It Be", "False");
```{{execute T1}}


```
SELECT * FROM portworx.songs WHERE();
```{{execute T1}}
