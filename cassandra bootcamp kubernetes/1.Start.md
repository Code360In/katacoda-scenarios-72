To have a real environment we will use Kubernetes and Cassandra for this we will first create the environment.


### Step: Create StorageClass

Create the storage class using:
```
kubectl create -f cassandra-sc.yaml
```{{execute T1}}


Now use kubectl to deploy Cassandra.
```
kubectl create -f cassandra.yaml
```{{execute T1}}

### Step: Verify Cassandra pod is ready (This takes a few minutes)

Below commands wait till the Cassandra pod are in ready state. Take note of the node it's running on.
```
watch kubectl get pods  -o wide
```{{execute T1}}

This takes a few minutes, when the cassandra-0 and cqlsh pods are in STATUS Running and READY 1/1 then hit ```clear```{{execute interrupt}} to ctrl-c and clear the screen.
