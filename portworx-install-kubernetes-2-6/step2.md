Let's set up a Portworx cluster. To do this, we will make use of an installation URL from central.portworx.com

What does Portworx need to be installed?

# 1. Drives: The drive /dev/vdb is available on each node which we will be using.
# 2. Key Value Database (KVDB): Such as ETCD. We will be using the Portworx Built-in KVDB instead of deploying our own.
# 3. Specification: Portworx is defined by a spec file, we will create the Portworx cluster using the spec URL.


Run the below command to install:

`kubectl apply -f 'https://install.portworx.com/2.6?mc=false&kbver=1.18.0&b=true&s=%2Fdev%2Fvdb&c=my-px-cluster&stork=true&st=k8s'`{{execute}}

Note: It can take a few minutes for the cluster to be Ready! Check that Portworx pods are running before you proceed to the next question.
`watch kubectl get pods -o wide -n kube-system -l name=portworx`{{execute}}

When you see all three Portworx nodes "1/1 Running" you can click ```clear```{{execute interrupt}}

Check the installation logs:
`PX_POD=$(kubectl get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'); kubectl -n kube-system logs -f $PX_POD`{{execute}}

To exit out of the logs, press (CTRL+C)


Warning: If the Portworx cluster is set up with an incorrect px-spec.yaml file, a cleanup would be needed before you attempt to re-install!
