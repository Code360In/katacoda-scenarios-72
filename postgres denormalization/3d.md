### Query 2: `select cashier_name, SUM(amount_spent) FROM <min number of tables> GROUP BY cashier_name` 

We could also do a `JOIN` on the tables we have created, but what if we do not want to have any `JOINS`, why not create a new table with just the information we need. 

`Table Name: cashier_sales
col: Transaction Id
Col: Cashier Name
Col: Cashier Id
col: Amount_Spent
`

``` {.sql}
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cashier_sales (transaction_id int, cashier_name varchar, 
                                                           cashier_id int, amount_spent int);
```{{execute}}

``` {.sql}
INSERT INTO cashier_sales (transaction_id, cashier_name, cashier_id, amount_spent) VALUES (1, 'Sam', 1, 40 ), (2, 'Sam', 1, 19), (3, 'Max', 2, 45);
```{{execute}}

Now let's run our query

```
select cashier_name, SUM(amount_spent) FROM cashier_sales GROUP BY cashier_name;
```{{execute}}


We have successfully taken normalized table and denormalized them in order to speed up our performance and allow for simplier queries to be executed.Â¶
