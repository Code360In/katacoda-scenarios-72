In this lab,  we will enable security for Portworx which is installed on this Kubernetes cluster. We have a 4-Node Kubernetes cluster with one master node and 3 worker nodes. Portworx is installed on this K8 Cluster in a Hyper-converged model.

Currently we do not have security enabled. 

Our end goal in this lab is to set up PX-Security, ensure it works and test storage operations.
