In this lab,  we will learn about ownership of resources in Portworx.


</br>
##### Portworx is currently being re-installed with Security enabled. Please wait for all pods to be updated. To check the status, click on the below command and wait for all Pods to have "2/2" ready containers:

`watch kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l name=portworx`{{execute}}


To get back to the terminal:
```clear```{{execute interrupt}}

Note: You cannot proceed to the next question until Portworx is Ready!
